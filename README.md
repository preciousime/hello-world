Introduction to repository on github

Hi there, I am interested in web development and data analysis. From a young age I loved numbers and I represented my high school in various mathematics competitions. Also, I love fashion. It is a form of expression for me and a little introduction to who I am. I enjoy eating and traveling. I love learning about new cultures - especially East Asian countries.
